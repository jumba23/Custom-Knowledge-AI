## Custom Knowledge AI (CKAI)

### What is CKAI?

This app is able to communicate with the user and answer questions using "LLM training" data (in pdf form - provided by the owner of the app). It is able to answer questions about the owner's knowledge base after searching through the pdf. We are going to be using openAI models to train the app to answer questions.

### How does it work?

The user is able to ask a question to the app. When the question is submitted, the app will search through the pdf and find the answer to the question. The app will then display the answer to the user using openAI models.
